"Recipes seem great, but these meal prep things frustrate me, because:
1. It never shows the time you spent on planning, shopping, preparing assembling and cleaning up, which usually takes a lot more time than the cooking itself.
2. According to this video, I still have to have quite a few other storebought items at home that I still need to assemble 
3. According to this video, I still have to use a pan almost every day (that I'll have to clean after, as well as the stove) and spend quite some time toasting bread, reheating my ingredients, not to mention putting ingredients in a blender (that I, once again, will have to clean) or rinsing my carrots and refilling the container with fresh water. If I already spent so much time, why would I not make an easy meal from scratch with fresh ingredients from the store? A simple hearty cup of noodle soup with some veggies takes less time than this.
4. I am essentially eating the same dish over and over, just in different configurations. Knowing myself, I will start to resent those ingredients after day 2.. Long story short, a diversity in meals issue that also takes away the joy of ""what do I feel like eating today?""
5. Meal prep for most people is also a thing that they should be able to take to work. I don't see how I could take the majority of these to work?

Meal prep always sounds great, but I just don't see it working for most people, at least not in this way.","[""how couldn't you take it to work ???""]",2024-10-19T19:49:26Z,@mchlle94

"Do you take an iron or b12 supplement? Could you do a video about how to be vegan and actually get your nutrients in. I ate like these recipes for a decade and became very nutrient defiecient. I am not saying people can't be vegan, but some people, people with hyper flexibility, anxiety, older people, sibo, ibs, various things this kind of diet is not sustainable without supplements and extra attention to protein, iron and b vitamins. Think floridex, eating vitamin c rich foods with dark greens, marmite, pea protein, nutritional yeast, yearly blood tests, stuff like that. Your recipes look and taste great but seriously aren't sustainable for some people, maybe for you and many others, but there is a reason many don't stay vegan.

THEN you get the sweet fluffy couscous we Moroccans love to eat. And i also make a lot and then freeze it (the couscous, not the chicken/veggie on top), so it is excellent for mealprep!

"This is so full of ideas ! Personnally I would make the pasta and couscous on the day I eat them because it takes juste 5-10min and I'm not in a hurry,but the dressing and preping a decent quantity in advance to prevent from either not eating them (feeling it's too long to prepare + ustensils to clean every night takes unnecessary time) or having to eat a looooot of the same in a rush because they are turning bad and we bought too much. I also like that carrots, canned bell pepper and tomates can be found any season so it's a great meal prep to try now and maybe you could make others like this for other seasons with little adaptation.",[],2024-09-29T17:44:16Z,@anonymcomment5864

"I just started making my own veggie stock instead of using bouillon. 
I simply boil all my veggie scraps especially the onion peels. ❤","[""Indeed, that's the right way! veggie stock is basically free and avoids ingesting all the crap the food industry puts into the bouillon cubes....""]",2024-09-26T17:00:42Z,@LynnDespatie
