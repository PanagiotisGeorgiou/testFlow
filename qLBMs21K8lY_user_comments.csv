"This is my favorite piece of home gym equipment.  So many options to strengthen your entire core ... the back extension feels so good. When you do side bends/leans, you realize how sturdy this machine is as there is no tilt even though all your body weight is on one side of the machine.  Phenomenal given the relatively low weight of the machine!  The leg developer attachment is fire!  I agree with your assessment on the leg extension.  One detail that is overlooked on the leg curl is the decline position you are in when doing the leg curl.  I did not realize this until I watched a friend do the leg curl on a flat bench.  When doing leg curl on a flat bench, it is easy for your low back to compress and/or have your butt raise.  Watching the top of the movement on the flat bench, you realize that you probably should be doing leg curl in a decline position.  Sooooo, when you do the leg curl on the Freak Athlete in decline position (as you show in your video), you preserve your lower back from the compression that comes with doing leg curl on a flat bench.  IMO, that is huge ... and overlooked.",[],2024-10-13T02:53:33Z,@HunterMalin

For a Nordic you can use a bench and a roller on a rack. Again alpha roller or single leg roller

Now if you didn‚Äôt have a rack and wanted a single piece of equipment this thing works.

"I purchased the older unit months ago and it has the smaller GHD pad. I'm 5'0"" and the machine fits me very well for almost every exercise. 

It really shines at training Nordics - I went from barely able to do a full Nordic at 40 degrees to now doing them at 20 degrees (I'm very close to full Nordics at 15 degrees). I trained Nordics for a year before the Freak Athlete machine and had poor results.  

45 degree back extensions are almost perfect - the only annoyance is that, due to my height, the center post pokes me slightly in the stomach at the bottom of movement. If I had a little more leg  length this would not be an issue. 

A surprising place the machine shines (at least for me, again due to my height), is reverse hypers. I use the small GHD pad and decline the foot plate end slightly do to reverse hypers. I attach Monkey Feet for weight. This setup allows me to swing the weights under and fully extend without any issues. This fits me better than any commercial reverse hypers I've used. The commercial machines are simply too big for me to use in a meaningful way.

All the other features work very well. I use the machine daily and it's been a great purchase.

"Great review. One comment about your hyper/back extension B-Tier rating. I‚Äôm very tall - 6‚Äô8‚Äù and while not sure about this updated version, I have the original model and I can do bar on shoulders barbell loaded hyper/back extensions without hitting my head, plates on ground, adjustment bar or anything else (I don‚Äôt even come close). The primary reason I got this vs the Shogun, Tib Bar guy version etc is because it does provide a higher positioning for a taller person while at 45 degrees doing back extensions than any of the other options. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôd actually rank the Nordic curl (of the original version) lower (B-tier) than the Hyper/Back Extension only because the pad is just not super comfortable on my knees (maybe because of my weight - 255). Edit: This issue, potentially hitting the adjustment post doing hypers, may be more likely with the new model geometry or may be more of an issue the (less tall) you are as you are going to be closer not further away from, this adjustment post.","[""Good info, as a short king, the experience is different so I love hearing from a tall king's perspective.
