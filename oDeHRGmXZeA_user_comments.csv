"Yes Jordan wore a pair of black toe over his shoulder with the text in the famous photo. But MJ and Nike threw out that option in favor of the beloved wings logo. No one liked the text when they were finalizing the finished product. Furthermore the ones over his shoulder had the tall upper collar and the straight up and down back which looks super dope. And look at the toe box on the ones over his shoulder, they are more slanted/pointed. This release is shaped nothing like the ones on his shoulder. These shoes have the puny, short upper collar that curves forward which all standard current Jordan 1’s have. Yeah for resellers they may be a must.

"The replacement of the Wings logo doesn't bother me, the aged midsole though is a major yuck BUT based on your video the aging effect doesn't look too bad. I passed on the L&Fs because they used the aged midsole but when I finally saw them in person the effect didn't seem that bad, though it also helped that the shoes in general has an aged look. The side panels on the L&Fs appeared to have a sail tinting as did the tongue so it stuck out alot less. Unfortunately, as it is in the sneaker kingdom, if you wait until you actually see a pair of hyped kicks on foot in person before making a purchasing decision, you're going to be doomed to paying resale and I have no intention on dropping 300+ on ANY pair of Js lol.

Irks the shit outta me how on the left the shoe the text doesn’t seem centered especially when you do compare them to the OG pair from the photoshoot,"['Yeah I’m not that pleased with how they placed the air Jordan logo either. It doesn’t look right how they placed it', '@@rxflyfishing1316 I’m glad I’m not the only one. That minute detail just throws me off as much as I hate to admit it lol but if they did it just like the OG pair, I think I’d be fine with it', '@@MathiasR1384 I’ve been pretty excited about this shoe coming out, and each review I see, I think why the F did they slant the logo and center it wrong 😢']",2024-09-18T03:07:30Z,@MathiasR1384

The Jordan rare air max orange was the first to ever release with the text. I remember seeing those years ago and forgot about them,['There are at least two more pairs in that series (blue/black and a grey pair) that have the text as well. I have the max orange pair 👍🏽'],2024-09-18T02:55:33Z,@angeldiaz2391
