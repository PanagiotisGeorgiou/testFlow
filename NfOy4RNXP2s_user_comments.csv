"In my view cadence is a result of optimized technique and not other way around.
If you correct your posture and stride the cadence will raise immediately without focusing on quicker or even shorter steps.
I think mouse stepping cannot lead to accurate running form without understanding the details, and the details cannot be understood without knowing how running is working in general.
People try to get their running feel right or look right, but almost everything you are getting used to will feel alright until you really do it right and than you feel and understand the difference.
Also if you let it look right it may be wrong because you changed the wrong parameters and again you confused cause with effect.","['Implementing the posture and landing tips alone shoul lead to a 170 cadence at least üëç if not there must be some other fault or the tendons and muscles are too weak still to produce enough elastic recoil.', ""Hmm i think i disagree. I think its more likely that form and cadence covary, so a change in one will cause a change in the other. Trying to run at 180 strides per minute will force us to correct our form to more efficiently sustain 180. And like you said, implementing a particular form can force a certain cadence. At the same time, i think trying to force one without adequately adjusting the other can lead to injury. All this keeping in mind that we all have a different natural gait and anatomical variations -- it's a huge balancing act with multiple approaches, some of which may be more or less efficacious depending on the individual athlete."", ""\u200b@@chindianajones3742 Ever Change may result in injury or current structural overload, or maybe feel hard or wrong even if it's the best.

"During early 2000s I've started jogging until I could jog for 1hr.  I was heel striking and I don't know if I had this bad backward tilt and heel stomping overstride, I guess I had. But I changed to forefoot running early so I must have run with a forward tilt, and sometimes I resorted to midfoot and heel, but didn't change posture.
The issue was, and today I realized and fixed it: The posture was quite ok but my leg movement originated from the slow jog heel strike, which means I landed on a to much flexed knee, this is like a bit of a squat each step. This wasn't fixed by changing to fore and midfoot!
It is like your body is in running mode and also both feet leave the ground, but legs still work similar to walking.
The only fix was to skip faster into the ground contact than my body moved downwards and get that stiff and bouncy feeling and the elastic recoil.
Now running feels totally different and much more efficient. 
I also fixed some other issues, fe I straightened my hollow back and gained much more elastic recoil and cadence immediately went up from 160 to 170!
Another fix was to adjust pelvis rotation with leg movement. This can easily be done: Run like sb is pushing you from behind. The hip rotation will fasten and advance to the legs movement which completely changes the mechanics and automatic muscle reflexes so the legs, especially the quads get really relaxed and even the heels swing up freely by itself.
Before my quads were to tense to let them swing high.
I guess that my pelvis learned to just follow the legs movement before and with more hip momentum it went to lead the running process instead which makes a big difference of how the mechanical parts work together and forces and reflexes are applied.
I admit that many good runners already have the right hip momentum, but many people don't, especially when they ask questions like why don't my heels come up.",[],2024-10-02T10:12:35Z,@Raucherbeinknacker

"Run faster and your form will improve. The reason recreational runners/joggers don't move like the elites is simply because they aren't  running even remotely close to the same pace!

Yep, I move just like an elite runner at that pace - high knee drive, pronounced forefoot strike, heels kissing my ass."", ""\u200b@@thegearboxmanyep, I not completely disagree, I also believe you can learn the best from your body itself. And even tips and tricks you must understand and practice on your own. But me, I was running quite a little fast, and I also did faster intervals also. But my technique was crap. Crap from top to floor. Why? Because I tried the wrong but the wrong felt rightüòÖ\nI could also sprint, I can still, but I will not be able to perfect it like a pro and maybe I won't even understand some crucial aspects of sprinting.\nI mean just running faster will not necessarily help you to refine your mechanics, it shows you another dynamics, you can adopt them partially but not completely.\nSome people find the right technique easier than others but everyone still has to refine."", ""@@Raucherbeinknacker There is an argument, to which I partially subscribe, that suggests that your body automatically adjusts to become the most efficient for that particular individual. The human body is very good at self-learning and protecting itself against injury. An absolute beginner probably won't run 'correctly', but someone who's been running consistently for a couple of years will already be running at *their* best in terms of form *for the pace they're going*. Trying to 'force' an unnatural movement is likely to result in injury. For example, if a runner is a natural heel striker (more than 90% of all runners) and then decides to force a forefoot strike (because they've read that's what most elite runners do) then this is a recipe for disaster. The biggest mistake that recreational (slow) runners make is too low cadence. If you increase cadence then other aspects of form tend to correct automatically."", ""@@thegearboxman If they're lucky.\nI used forefoot, midfoot and also heel. And I didn't have a hunch about what was still wrong.\nAnd when I found out and fixed these bugs point for point the cadence went from approx. 150 to 160 to 170 and finally with medium pace (fast for me) to 180.\nAnd I couldn't have made these fixes if I hadn't detected the issues.\nAlthough I varied with my footstrike and used midfoot mainly, although I had a good upright posture and the main load of each step was under my center of mass, there were certain things wrong, and I couldn't detect them by running faster or increasing cadence.\nFirst was a lack of recoil caused by landing on too much flexed knees. Indeed I cured this out by skipping down quicker to stiffen my legs, which resulted in a stiff and bouncy run I've never before experienced!\nFrom there I straightened my lower back yet a little more and my body could take full advantage of the elastic recoil. But I had to find the optimal recoil first, then refine my posture.\nLastly I tried more hip engagement which took much strain from the legs and even let my heels swing up. The best method to hasten your pelvis rotation is to run like being pushed forward. It's kinda magic effect.üòÖ without this I'd never run with flying heels and freely moving without unnecessary muscle effort.\nAnd without stepping faster I reached the 180 cadence, only by refining technique.""]",2024-09-18T13:16:36Z,@thegearboxman

Cadence has a lot to do with speed. Beginners always like to take advice from elite runners and Ive seen some weird bouncers out there trying to hit 185 while jogging 6:40min per km.

If your cadence in slow runs is too low then you will train your muscle memory to a false pattern of movement. Try to concentrate on perfect technique in your slow runs. I would rather run at smaller step length than falling to a slow jog that ruins my technique where arms also move differently. Smaller step length does not mean you have to jump up and down at every step. But naturally it is easier to reduce bouncing movement when gaining speed.']",2024-09-15T21:10:06Z,@jepulis6674
