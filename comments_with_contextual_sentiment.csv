"A strange thing happened to me a few months ago, I guess. I can no longer enjoy music. I no longer want to make music. You know it's fucking over when you cannot name ANY memorable song in the past 2-3 years.

Do I want to be gay or not gay, I don't know.

*M-Audio sucks dick btw.

Anyway, at the moment, on the humble bundle site, Sampletank4 is $1 and ACID, Samplitude, blah blah is like $25. Maybe you can find that useful, I dunno.

"I had a friend who got the old king korg and she let me try it out.  Wasnt really anything special then she told me she paid 1300 for it.  R3 radias ms2000 etc were way better imho.  I cant believe people still try to sell the kingkorg for 800-900.  It felt like an electribe 2 synth engine with more polyphony and a few additions.  Almost reminded me of using a vst without a good controller.  

This new thing should be 400 bucks tops I think.  I really like my minilogue and im a fan of the volcas but they still havent made anything that would make me switch from any of the other synths I mentioned in years.  Wouldnt mind something to switch to as well because my ms2000 and radias are getting pretty beat up.

"I think Behringer is spoiling us with their cheaper offerings, and Korg/Roland now appear more expensive these days. £1k for this neo is silly money. Korg seem to have gone down the same route as Roland using a proprietary chip and software developers. Look at the Wavestate, Opsix, and Modwave, all similar build quality and I bet they have 1 main FPGA they use for whatever code they want. Just like Roland ZenCore and ACB tech. I suppose they can put any synth new or old into these chips, modify the hardware a bit, rename the buttons & sliders, knobs, etc, and voila endless new products or reissues .. Makes good business sense, but are customers starting to wake up to the con? I have!.. My pc can do it all with controller keyboard. This will be in a vst soon you watch. 😏 But the price needs to be at least 50% cheaper than what it is. I've just seen a neo for £885.00 still too much. I suppose digital cloning is easier to enforce, Behringer can't just use someone else's code, that's why they only do analogue mainly.

"Dieser Mann sagt nur die Wahrheit!  Gut gemacht.

Not long after this synth was announced, I learned: 1) it had the same not-so-hot keyboard action as all of Korg's similarly sized synths (Modwave, Opsix, etc), 2) it changed almost nothing from the previous KingKORG engine, and 3) the price was significantly higher than expected (and definitely higher than a used OG, FS KingKORG).

Best thing about this release?  Used prices on the OG, FS KingKORG dropped, and I picked one up for an even better price.  Makes a great live synth (minus the wall wart power supply) with respectable VA poly and mono synth tones.  

Suggestion to Korg: How about a 16-voice VA based on the MS-2000/MicroKORG engine?? Add a quality keybed like the UNO Synth Pro, and it would sell like crazy, I'm pretty sure.

Edit:  and I just saw at the end of the video you suggested almost the exact same thing for Korg.  Let's hope they listen.",['Thank you!!!'],2024-09-28T06:35:42Z,@ProckGnosis,,Positive

"I fully agree about the opportunity for the SE to be a multi engine synth combining opsix, modwave and wavestate engines.

I'm also very much wondering if multi timbral is going to come back into fashion.

"For an “amateur” as you say (I'd never say that), Jam 2 sounds pretty good. Recently I've rewatchted an old Jack Duxbury (Andertons Synths) video in which he unrested & bleary-eyed (what was hilarious) checked the JD Xi, the Ultranova and the microkorg XL for similarities. In terms of analogue sound, the microkorg XL killed it's competitors easily with an authentic & natural (not at all VA-tainted) tone quality. Therefore, I assume the current microkorg 2 could eventually be in certain ways higher developed than the KingKorg Neo, what also represents as this times suggestion.
