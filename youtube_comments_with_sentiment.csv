You know it's fucking over when you cannot name ANY memorable song in the past 2-3 years.

"I had a friend who got the old king korg and she let me try it out.  Wasnt really anything special then she told me she paid 1300 for it.  R3 radias ms2000 etc were way better imho.  I cant believe people still try to sell the kingkorg for 800-900.  It felt like an electribe 2 synth engine with more polyphony and a few additions.  Almost reminded me of using a vst without a good controller.  

This new thing should be 400 bucks tops I think.  I really like my minilogue and im a fan of the volcas but they still havent made anything that would make me switch from any of the other synths I mentioned in years.  Wouldnt mind something to switch to as well because my ms2000 and radias are getting pretty beat up.

"I think Behringer is spoiling us with their cheaper offerings, and Korg/Roland now appear more expensive these days. ¬£1k for this neo is silly money. Korg seem to have gone down the same route as Roland using a proprietary chip and software developers. Look at the Wavestate, Opsix, and Modwave, all similar build quality and I bet they have 1 main FPGA they use for whatever code they want. Just like Roland ZenCore and ACB tech. I suppose they can put any synth new or old into these chips, modify the hardware a bit, rename the buttons & sliders, knobs, etc, and voila endless new products or reissues .. Makes good business sense, but are customers starting to wake up to the con? I have!.. My pc can do it all with controller keyboard. This will be in a vst soon you watch. üòè But the price needs to be at least 50% cheaper than what it is. I've just seen a neo for ¬£885.00 still too much.

"Dieser Mann sagt nur die Wahrheit!  Gut gemacht.

Not long after this synth was announced, I learned: 1) it had the same not-so-hot keyboard action as all of Korg's similarly sized synths (Modwave, Opsix, etc), 2) it changed almost nothing from the previous KingKORG engine, and 3) the price was significantly higher than expected (and definitely higher than a used OG, FS KingKORG).

Best thing about this release?  Used prices on the OG, FS KingKORG dropped, and I picked one up for an even better price.  Makes a great live synth (minus the wall wart power supply) with respectable VA poly and mono synth tones.  

Suggestion to Korg: How about a 16-voice VA based on the MS-2000/MicroKORG engine?? Add a quality keybed like the UNO Synth Pro, and it would sell like crazy, I'm pretty sure.

Edit:  and I just saw at the end of the video you suggested almost the exact same thing for Korg.  Let's hope they listen.",2024-09-28T06:35:42Z,@ProckGnosis,0.035,0.791,0.174,0.9742

"Another great episode!

~1:07 The color scheme is NOT one of the things truly wrong with the Astrolab, imo (and I actually think white synths can look pretty damn good). The real problem is that, iirc, you can't even make your own patches on the hardware! And to make your own period, you need hundreds of dollars in additional software! Ridiculous. The KingKorg Neo is already way better in that regard. Though over a grand definitely seems like too much for it, haha. 

Especially with that in mind, it (KGN) doesn't seem too bad. Things like the Wavestate and Modwave are maybe more appealing to me, but this little guy seems *alright* (though again, that price, haha. Not the worst in that regard, but still).",2024-09-27T22:04:18Z,@slipknotboy555,0.052,0.745,0.203,0.962

"For an ‚Äúamateur‚Äù as you say (I'd never say that), Jam 2 sounds pretty good. Recently I've rewatchted an old Jack Duxbury (Andertons Synths) video in which he unrested & bleary-eyed (what was hilarious) checked the JD Xi, the Ultranova and the microkorg XL for similarities. In terms of analogue sound, the microkorg XL killed it's competitors easily with an authentic & natural (not at all VA-tainted) tone quality. Therefore, I assume the current microkorg 2 could eventually be in certain ways higher developed than the KingKorg Neo, what also represents as this times suggestion. Anyway, not always successors stand out positively from their predecessors, what applies not just to instruments, even more to the whole audio industry in general. Anyway Microkorg 2 is this times tip (but I'm of course unaware if it sounds similar ot better than the XL).",2024-09-27T17:02:32Z,@Gerald_Daniel,0.053,0.82,0.127,0.883

"The OG King Korg wasn't so bad. I gigged with it for a while and used it for a bunch of studio stuff. To be fair tho, I did buy it 7 years after release for half the original price. Also, check out the Snarky Puppy Lingus video and see what synth Cory Henry is playing during his 3 minute long synth solo. That said, I sold it to get a summit lol.",2024-09-27T16:24:22Z,@Fightwithmonsters,0.0,0.824,0.176,0.8953

"This is an odd one. My guess is that this is meant to be a step up for non-synthesists who want to step up from the MicroKorg; It doesn't have the deepest engine in the world, but everything sounds really good without a huge amount of effort and it has really nice vocoder. It does a lot, it sounds good, it's fairly easy...I can imagine a market for it, but that price. Oooooof.",2024-09-27T16:21:36Z,@ridleykemp5789,0.055,0.774,0.17,0.8855

Microkorg 2 should have had Granular Synthesis and FM. Seems to me they're starting to churn out one Wavetable rompler after another these days. The joystick looks as cheap as the one on my microKey Air which fly's off if you blow on it :D,2024-09-27T16:10:32Z,@dreikelvin,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.694
