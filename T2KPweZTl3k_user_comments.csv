"Tyson is the GOAT.

If he trained Mike Tyson could've fought forever.

With trainer, nutrition, and designer PEDs you can fight for a long time. 

Tyson in his prime demolishes both Lenox and Evander.

It's not a hot take either. Tyson beat Lenox in sparring as teenagers and a prime Mike Tyson with Cus for 10 years would've been just fine. 

Attrition isn't as big a factor with genetic freaks like Tyson (in addition to the aforementioned variables i cited earlier).

Tyson is #2 BEST (not ""greatest"") heavyweight of all time. Only Ali was better. And even then I think Tyson could beat him. He was a freak of nature.",[],2024-09-20T02:06:52Z,@feynmanschwingere_mc2270

"Mike Tyson needed a real friend like Cus not people who feared him and hung around for the money.
Unfortunately after Cus death  Mike ended up with 3 devils Don King, Robin Givens and her mother. They took advantage of a kid.
In the ring he was a beast outside the ring he was kid looking for love and trust.
When people know your weakness that’s what they take advantage of.
Two comments posted a true statement had Cust not died and Tyson not got caught into Don Kings BS Tyson would have never been beaten.
Under Cust and his team Mike was a scientist and a brilliant fighter.
Plus these guys truly cared for Mike and they kept him disciplined.
That Italian saw a gift and he saw talent and he perfected that man’s ability to fight and box.
Unfortunately the right brother didn’t get to Mike before and after Custamado.
To see anyone succeed coming from the lifestyle Mike Tyson had is a joy.
Unfortunately trusting the wrong people was his issue.

Mike was killing people when he was young. He hit people so hard that I think they forgot their name. Then Gus died and when that happened I think a part of Mike died with him because Mike definitely changed after that. Even though he was still kicking ass you could tell there was something different about him. It's like he kinda lost his way even though he became the youngest boxer to win the title Mike seemed lost in my opinion. Mike lost his father figure and Mike loved being part of Gus's family. Mike always wanted that father figure in his life and then when Jacobs died he lost his 2nd father figure. After that Mike just became a animal that was let out of the cage. He didn't have anyone to hold that animal back and Mike was just out of hand especially when Don King came into the picture. At least now Mike is in his 50s and the beast inside has calmed down and he's at peace with himself. I love his podcast Hot Box In. I wish nothing but the best for Mike in the future because he deserves it.,[],2021-08-14T03:05:13Z,@froey198033

"Cus D’Amato was an older man at the time of his death, so talking about Cus living throughout Tyson’s entire career to protect him is unrealistic, unfortunately. However, even with that being said, Cus still set Mike up for success after his passing. He positioned Kevin Rooney to continue the style of training Mike required, and set up people like Jim Jacobs and Bill Clayton to manage his career from the business side of things. Don King got involved following Jacobs’ death, and stripped away the layers of protection Cus had installed before his death. It was all down hill after that. Had Rooney remained his trainer, and Jacobs-Clayton managed his career, my personal opinion is that Mike Tyson did not have a ceiling.

"When I was younger, as a German, all boxing I would hear about was basically the Klitschko brothers.
When I was a teenager, I spoke to my father about boxing. He said: ""I don't think there'll ever be another boxer like Mike Tyson. That guy was something else. I would set my alarm to like 2 AM so I could watch Mike Tyson fights live, and I was mostly back in bed very soon."" I watch this in the light of the Roy Jones fight. Before this, I basically knew that Mike was a once in a lifetime phenomenon that was pretty much consumed by his demons. After watching this, it's really tragic. With such a rough childhood and youth, anyone would be crazy to some degree. What could have been if Cus had lived longer? After he was gone, it appears that Mike just surrounded himself with the wrong people. Used to have a father figure keeping you in check and setting you on a proper course, now there's a bunch of snakes who want to get money off you and don't give a rat's ass about your well-being. Poor Mike. Happy to see that he appears to have set himself straight now.",[],2020-11-29T13:01:43Z,@Kharn996

"This is a really nice video. But you can't have a complete video without briefly mentioning the role of Teddy Atlas alongside Cus D'Amato. Although it was nice to see a couple clips of Teddy training him, Cus and Teddy both mentored Mike at the same time. Obviously Cus was the father figure and Teddy the big brother.  As his trainer, Teddy was there from the beginning and with him every single day. Teddy was also Cus' pupil. So Teddy was able to teach Mike everything Cus taught him. Teddy taught him very well. In those early years, he was a crucial part of Mike's development and eventual success, prior to leaving due to the gun altercation.  Cus, Teddy Atlas, Kevin Rooney, Jim Jacobs.... these guys were the glue.... the family that kept him centered and together. Teddy left, then Cus died, then Jacobs died, then Kevin left. That was the final blow. Once Don King got involved and Kevin was forced out, the legend of Mike Tyson as we knew it, would soon be over.  I believe if Tyson stuck with Rooney and stayed close to his roots in the Catskills, he might have retired one day as an undefeated champion.",[],2020-08-13T16:44:03Z,@digitalgr8ness

After getting the standing fighter to a neutral corner, the referee is supposed to look at the man with the white gloves and pick up the count wherever that guy has it at. But if you look at this fight the man in white gloves was at 2 but the referee started the count at 1. Whenever the referee is at 3 the man in white gloves is at 5.

He was the champ for a long time in my mind as i look back. But Cus never saw him even become champ? How do people blame his downfall on the loss of Cus?
About halfway thru and its simple from this documentary, thats brilliant btw, is that his downfall was a bad woman, a bad new father figure in Don King, who were both after his money.

Rocky was white, slow, plodding, but powerful and had amazing endurance/stamina, while Mike was black, powerful, fast, and vicious.. but eventually, shown to lack endurance and stamina. Rocky also retired at the right age, still disciplined and undefeated.. while Mike gradually lost his focus, motivation and eventually retired several times. Rocky was his own man, while for Mike, Cus (a white) built him, but Don King (a black) eventiually destroyed him.

I see this shots, and i have seen them 10000 times over when i was boxing and i could not understand it. The precision of the left shot comes from the right foot, but the perfection of the whole body movement it's truly amazing, i do not think that there will ever be a man who hits so hard ever again, i think Mike had some body advantages, amazing training from the greatest trainers of all ""Constantine D'Amato"" but most important his power, i think, it  was generated from the pain he felt, i think the fear/frustration/heart broken, all the feelings somehow put him in a state of self defense  and trough that he generated incredible amount of power in his shots.",[],2020-01-10T08:53:12Z,@Adrian-zm8sb

"That donnie long hit was brutal, frazier style, bring the left from outside and give it all you got. Tyson did that better on account of his height ,  he leaped and put his whole body weight behind that hook and whosoever in front would go down. He had a reach disadvantage but he counteted it by using the leaping technique. Foreman , another hard hitter like tyson but he wasnt fast and just focussed on hitting, didnt even bother to defend hut tyson, hits hard, fast, decent defensive technique of bringing both hands and covering face llike how islam people pray to almighty god? Then that neck, it was bolted to his shoulder, hard, rock hard . But he had too  much aggression , beyond control, if he wasnt boxing , he probably be a gang member and seriel killer, destroyed everyone  in sight, man or woman, fighter or trainer, just like a tank .",[],2019-12-14T02:36:16Z,@vik_body_beld7294

"Ok. Things about Tyson. No he wasn’t the hardest hitting heavyweight ever not in the top three. They are shavers foreman and Liston. Liston was the scariest man in the ring period. The fastest fighter at heavyweight is Ali who would run rings around Tyson. Prime Tyson went the distance with binecrusher Smith. I hate to say it but prime Tyson is a myth. He’s not in most people who know boxing’s top ten heavyweight of all time. Against Douglas, the count is an arbitrary ten count not ten seconds. Holyfield would have beaten Tyson because Tyson is not an infighter. Foreman was ducked by Tyson who knew he would lose to him. You can’t blame don king and robin givens for what he did to himself.

From what I remember of that fight, he never really got in there and mixed it up with Tyson.  He was looking kind of smug when he came out and they introduced him.  But, as soon as the bell rang and it was for real, he looked like a clown.  He kept going down and his trainer ended up throwing in the towel to stop the fight.  I remember my Dad being pissed off because that Pay Per View was $60 or $70 and the Tyson fight was a joke!  When Mike Tyson came back from prison, he looked pissed off like he was a man on a mission to prove something to the world that he was a serious threat not to be taken lightly.

It would have been hard to put him ahead of ali and some other old timers simply cause the competition in the late 80s early 90s in the heavy weight division was still no where close to top notch. To me personally as an ex boxer just based on what i saw from tysons prime he IS a top 3 (but i LOVE him) because he had the technique, the skill, the speed, the devastating power in both arms. you take that peak tyson and chuck him a ring with ANYONE for me it's simply impossible to say he definitely looses cause one good bob and a left hook and bam you are down..no discussion.",[],2019-08-26T14:49:35Z,@comerunwithmig

"I always Hasted what That DICK   >Don human-troll King<   DID TO MIKE Tyson,  Mike was a Nice guy outside the ring Until  King got his hooks into the Money train and he did Nothing but Ruin What Might have been the BEST Fighter in Boxing History!!  BUT Sadly we will Never know thank to a Greedy TROLL as people claim race BS  CUS did not see color in the way King Exploiteed Mike when he wanted More $$ for Mike to fight some lame ass Pay Per view!! All king ever did was figure out NEW ways to Bleed Mike for as Long as he could all while acting like he cared about Mike. 
   The Sad Part is ""CUS"" will Never have his Revenge on King BC ""CUS"" is in Heaven and we all Know King is going to Hell and Not Just for what he did to Mike But through out his whole so called Promoting ( or as others call it ...Looking how to bleed everyone for as Much as Possible all while you pay for Nothing). What pissed me off alot About King was he would RIP Into White Promoters claiming they were ROBBING Black Boxers.....all while he was Triple Dipping on Mike Tyson and re labeling it as  some absurd BS charge all to RIP off the Very same Boxer he claim he loved........the only thing King loved was the MONEY he was ROBBING from MIKE TYSON!!!   It is sad to see any Promoter rip off a Fighter & especially a Black Promoter aka King openly ripping MIKE OFF and he was even Questioned about it at the Press Conference during the Buster Douglas Fight ...A reporter asked something like Don why is it your staying in a 5 Star Hotel and MIKE Tyson is staying in some Dive 30 buck a Night Joint?    ...King said Tyson requested a Shitty room to keep his Mind Focused as King said.  A few months later a reporter asked Mike in person about  that hotel stay and asked I guess the last hotel stay made No difference to which Mike  later on said he was unaware of why he stayed where he did and went on to say my Manger (now King sadly) arranges all that yet another way to MILK his CASH COW!! A Black Man claiming to care Ruined the Best Fighter that Probably ever Laced up a set of Gloves and all the Hard work 2 OLD White Guys ""CUS"" & Jim (jacobs..who died sadly, I think if either had lived NONE of this Down ward King Induced Career ending Spiral would EVER Had Happened)  You could see King trying hard too push Jim Jacobs out of Mikes Life. Like during the Berbick Fight in 86 & BC it was around Thanks Giving time MIKE was looking for LOVE (family type, Not sex type) with King looking for A chance to jump in & side step JIM & act like a loving Father figure King BS 'D his way into mikes fragile mind around then which was what King was trying to do!! 
  You Could CLEARLY TELL Mike Loved Both CUS & JIM Because after  Each Fight he Kissed them Out of Respect and as a Son would Kiss His Father figure........ YOU NEVER SAW That Happen with Douche bag King !  I think subconsciously Mike Knew King was a Dick but BC he was still only 20-21 ish & Never really had People trying to screw him in the Boxing Game BC ""CUS & JIM""  Where His Dad's and Family DOES NOT Screw sons out of Money only some Sleazy salesman types claiming they care!! 
   I always Wished some Reporter would ask Mike or King why Mike Never kissed king like he did CUS or JIM ???  WE all Know the Real Reason I just always wondered what Mike or Corrupt King would say?!!

    To get real hear for a second Cable and Network have for years struggled with Content / shows..........all BC they are afraid to push the Boundaries of Video/Story Telling .......we all Know the reason its  SPONSORS  everything needs to fit with in a certain Ratings  Guideline and for a Storyteller I am sure that has to SUCK HUGE!!!  so People are Turning to other Outlets like  YT (sadly they are falling into the same TV trouble BC sponsors are wanting a More vanilla aka same old same old reason most ppl left to come to YT or ONLINE/Direct Content......BC we all Know you can be More Honest with your Storytelling & if it requires say Nudity, Swearing, a touch of realism, sexism etc..or an Out of the BOX comment to Fit the Narrative of the Video then they as Openly Free (as it should Always be for the Best experience in absorbing the intended aim of the Videos Creator ..sadly Now a days this can ONLY be done ONLINE or Netflix, Now Amazon (but sometimes they take some heat Still but they normally tell the Whining Few to Fuck off AS IT SHOULD BE!!)

The fact that Mike overcame everything and came out the man he is now is amazing in itself. He is obviously a very caring individual.

"like EVERY OTHER STAR IN THE US SATANIC ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY they must be suffer a free fall in their peak and prime of their career and Mike Tyson was no exception . 
we all knew even before watching this video which was more to the point and clear to tell this story , since Jimmy Jacobs passed the wolves who were stalking Mike Tyson gathered for an attack ,
Mike Tyson as he said it himself was never meant to experience such life .he was from a place where lives worth less than a dollar bill.

they quickly put that puppet Bitch Robin Givens in his life since they knew Mike was still a boy who needs love and attention and she was beautiful. and she robbed him from his guts and soul and her Witch mother Helped her in this . DON KING who is still as low as a street thief working for the mob was in it too .then they make sure he gets his free fall in his peak with that Miss Reptilian Desiree Washington who's whole family specially his father would sell or money. Mike Tyson was only a Victim of the Mobster Don King there.
Evander was a complete cheater whenever the going got tough, he always headbutted . and they again had told the Ref to turn a blind eye , they did it for both fights. a free fall of a star does a few important things which is a way of the Satanic entertainment industry which are mostly about the money and some about satisfying the Devil.
before ANYTHING we need to know the fact that all the Gambling , boxing ,Casinos , the UFC ,horse race ,ANYTHING PEOPLE BET ON, is ran by the mob , everything is closely watched , specially the money.not a cent is neglected.
the MOB is ran by the CIA. so that is clear now to everybody. if anyone has doubts they better start the research . the CIA runs MANY other things with the MOB inside the US and outside the US. 

1-  it makes A LOT OF MONEY on his loss on the fight night because they arrange the loss and while buster Douglas , a nobody on whom NO ONE in their right mind would bet over Mike Tyson who kills people in the Ring every time they Bet all the money on the nobody, 
imagine , what Professional corner forgets the to bring the Endswell which is like to forget to Bring the stool .
and there is No CUTMAN OMG. i am Sure Buster Douglas said he would shock the world because there were Spies in mike Tyson's Gym and he was being informed everyday on how mike was being trained for the fight , and Buster knew very well this was going to be his first and last appearance as a famous Boxing Figure as an upsetter . and then we have the ref who counts 13 for the 8 count yet let's Buster get up but doesn't allow Mile to have his 8 full count. 
so i guess i do not need to give more details which everyone already knows .

2- while the fall of the star makes a HUGE money , his comeback makes even More money .
3- other than they money they get from the betting and the people , all of the money of the Victimized Star is taken away from him/her .do you think they belong to the star????? the money belongs to the slave master .and these star are only slaves. 
Mike tyson said this exact word for his managers. 

4-the competition is always among Gangs or  ""GYMs"" .
they are Gangs not Gyms. they only look like Gyms. the gyms are where the training takes place. the real competition is always done elsewhere. 
they make money by playing with these gangs .they open way for one , then for a better money turn them down and let others rise. 
A FIGHTER or a Star who refuses to lose or is unbeatable is taken down like this or like what they did to JON JONES, 
and many more ,Mohammad Ali .
5- the Devil hates men , so when he allows them to gain from this world by his power he always makes sure they suffer the downfall more than they ever enjoyed their success , they will suffer 10 times more than each happy minuet. 

6- and finally , this way they will make sure that they will make a HUGE amount of money whe these people pass away ,.or die in a sacrifice ritual .
like they make 1o times more than they did when the star was alive after they die ,and they mostly die controversial deaths in which they always make sure that the fans and the people get shocked and they make speculations rise for days or weeks after he/she is dead .this is how they make tons of money with their career after they die.

"Mike Tyson is my favorite boxer ever and his fighting style is exactly like mine and though I’ve never boxed professionally I have always interacted with conflict and/or other obstacles throughout life with the same ferocious intent.  When he lost to buster Douglas it was either on purpose or because of the mental meds they had him on he did not slip or try to avoid any punches he was not there, big difference in his style of fighting in that fight.  It broke my heart.",[],2018-10-29T07:44:01Z,@gabrielgriffin9935
"Something I noticed in the fight with Douglas...and it sounds sappy but....there’s was no love in his boxing anymore.   He just didn’t care.  In his earlier fights, I could feel the fact that he loved the sport, the fact that he cared.  But after Givens and King messed his career up, that all changed.  After he got convicted and came out, those fights were an obvious example of what happened when he put his all into it.  But the cocaine...the women...the sharks in the industry...they sapped him of that.  He’s scary asf, but I can tell that he’s got a good heart bc Custanado and Jacobs brought that out in him.

"I truly believe that Mike never wanted to box again after Cus died. I'm not sure he ever really loved boxing, but he did love Cus, and Cus wanted to create one more champion before he died. For a kid who spent the first 15 years of his life never being loved by anyone that's a powerful motivation. After Cus died I think lacing up those gloves and stepping in the ring just carried too much sadness and memories. That's why he started training less and less, then doing more and more drugs to numb himself. 

Even worse, was surrounding himself with people who pretended to love him and being too high and naive to see through it...until it was too late. A snake like Don King easily saw what Mike needed, and he played him like a fiddle while acting like a father figure and robbing him blind. By that point he could never really quit boxing because he didn't know anything else and he had already lost much of his 300 million dollar fortune on drugs and giving Rolls Royces to people he barely knew so that they would like him. 

So he had to keep showing up, even has his speed and skills faded. He had to act crazier and crazier to keep people buying tickets. In a perfect world Cus would've lived 7 or 8 more years and guided Mike to a belt and a 10 good title defenses. Then Cus could've made him hang up the gloves and live off the $200 million he invested for him. Mike could've got into acting and writing a lot sooner and done all the other things he seemed to enjoy much more than boxing. 

Fighters who rely on their speed and reflexes like that don't have long careers because once they they lose a little of that they become much too hittable and can't counter like they used to. Slow footed sluggers like Foreman can fight forever because they never needed speed anyway. Tyson should've been retiring undefeated about 1993, 1995 at the latest. Instead, he was just getting out of prison and would go on to box for another 8 years. 

It's amazing he did as well as he did against Holyfield and Lewis after the years away from the ring and all the drugs. Not to mention the complete lack of training, picking a different trainer for every fight and never listening to them anyway. Evander and Lennox are two of the best heavyweights in history, both top 10 easily by anyone's measure. They would've been tough fights for Mike at any time of his career. But after prison and cocaine and all that? It was almost criminal to trot a shot Tyson out there to take a beating like that. And with his iron chin, he damn sure took a beating. He could've gave up 100 punches earlier in any of those fights and nobody would've said a word but he stood there in front of them and took his beating like man. Just a sad damn story and I hope he's able to stay clean and find some happiness with the rest of his life. 

One last thing - Holyfield is great, has a ton of heart, and was always respectful to Mike after the fights. They even get along today after everything that happened. But it pisses me off that Lewis still likes to talk shit every time someone puts a microphone in front of him. I guess he's earned it because he did win but everyone knows that you didn't beat Mike Tyson as much as you beat ''the ghost of Mike Tyson'', or ''the shell of Mike Tyson.'' If Lennox fought him in 1990 and beat him like that then I'd have no problem but it's too much like when Holmes beat a 40something version of Ali and then acted like he was the greatest ever. Watching Tyson demolish him later still makes me smile, and I'm sure Ali appreciated it too.","['A W wowww thank you so much for this', 'Tyson is the GOAT.\n\nIf he trained Mike Tyson could\'ve fought forever.\n\nWith trainer, nutrition, and designer PEDs you can fight for a long time. \n\nTyson in his prime demolishes both Lenox and Evander.\n\nIt\'s not a hot take either. Tyson beat Lenox in sparring as teenagers and a prime Mike Tyson with Cus for 10 years would\'ve been just fine. \n\nAttrition isn\'t as big a factor with genetic freaks like Tyson (in addition to the aforementioned variables i cited earlier).\n\nTyson is #2 BEST (not ""greatest"") heavyweight of all time. Only Ali was better. And even then I think Tyson could beat him. He was a freak of nature.']",2018-10-13T02:18:57Z,@aw5366

Mike has done nothing to be called the goat over ali or sugar Ray Leonard or somebody like that. Those guys beat absolute monsters. Those guys beat the highest quality fighters you could beat and they bet multiple of them.', '@@wutang5503 Mike Tyson truly is the best fighter of all time, u fucking dumb wutang']",2018-10-07T22:54:44Z,@Mike_The_Hog_A_Nator

He lost to the only big name people after his life was so far messed up.  Don king deserved to Die for not helping Tyson and enabling his bad doings.   It was all about the money for Don King.   What a waste he was.

"There was a MAJOR detail left out of this video: when that piece of shit leech Don King convinced Tyson to fire Kevin Rooney.  Rooney was fired by Tyson after the Spinks fight. 

In Tyson's first fight without Rooney, Tyson nearly got knocked down by Frank Bruno. 

I still contend that Tyson should have beat Douglas by KO IN the 8th, but it's his own fault that he got so sloppy. 

In the end, it was Tyson who fired Rooney, Tyson who did drugs, and Tyson who killed Tyson's career.

Tyson's people appealed the count and the decision and the count and it didn't get overturned. Then when Tyson was knocked down it seemed to me the ref gave him the same count that Douglas did. The difference was that Douglas got up in time. Give Douglas his due. He was the better fighter that night and he knocked him out. I will also give Tyson his due.

It's sad what Don King did to Tyson. King ruined part of Tyson's life. Bankrupted him and turned him into everything his other coaches trained him not to be. He even disrupted his boxing skills. I'd like to see what Mike would've done without Don King ever coming into his life.,"['Aquabat zap So many devils out there...', ""Or even better than just no Don King.. Cus lives another 5-6 years. That's another half decade of destruction."", '30 years later and that vulture son of motherless goat Don King is still out there ruining the lives of clueless young fighters.', '@@jamesdjl4359 without Don King Mike Tyson would have been one of the rare landmark athletes of the century. Possibly Jordanesque.', 'And it was from his own “people”.  This is where I find the black racists to be hypocrites...']",2017-07-06T14:15:49Z,@aquabatzap7698

"Tyson fought ""Tomato Cans"". Michael Spinks was his biggest win. There is a conspiracy that Tyson took a dive against Douglas. I wouldn't doubt it. ""Big Van Vader"" (Leon White) was at the Tyson/Douglas fight and actually heard Tyson tell Douglas, ""Now, Now, hit me now!"" This also came from Jim Cornette. Cornette said that Vader said, ""I can't believe this shit! Tyson threw that fight!"" Tyson never beat a ""world beater"". He knocked these ""glass eyed joe's"" out, whom nobody knows.","[""Spetsnaz Pocomaxa the tomato cans your talking about we're mostly in the beginning of his career when was fighting two times a month sometimes.its called sharpening your skills.20 years old became the champion.is it his fault that who was there at the time he was champ even after no.he fought everyone that was there.being Lewis was older, holyfeild was a pro,so on n so on.where were they?oh yeah still training to become where a younger Tyson already was.razor ruddick,Carl willams,,we're more ranked then them guys were at the time is that his fault?the razor fights alone showed Tyson toughness.when Lewis fought him it was later n started close.people can say this n that about him not fighting anyone.the fuckin so called champs like Lewis , holyfeild,etc.were supposed to be there same time if not soon then Tyson but wasn't at that level n if they were n you truly believe that they would have beaten a faster, harder puncher with either hand, crippling body attacker,not to mention one of the best hardest to defense anyone seen from a heavyweight like Tyson at that time.which your hero's Lewis n the other bitch never became.then I really don't know what kind of hate people have to make them that much in denial.if Tyson never lost himself and stayed on the straight and narrow.these careers of some would have been a lot different.smh""]",2017-07-03T05:14:39Z,@MrHoover77
